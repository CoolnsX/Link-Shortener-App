# Link-Shortener-App
This is the source code of Link shortener App created by Me. So you can use it and edit it yourself as it is not hard to understand about source code. 
This Link Shortener Script works on the modules that are installed in your system by default. 
But there are some modules that requires download before using them.
Those modules are : requests, pyperclip. After Installing these you can use Link Shortener App.
